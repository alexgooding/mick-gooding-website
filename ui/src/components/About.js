              I come from a family of artists. Whilst living in Boston, USA in the late 80's I was inspired to paint by the abundance of art galleries & art studios. 
              It was in Boston that I studied art. On returning to England I was a finalist in the BBC TV's Art '90 Competition in Manchester. 
              I have exhibited on London's Bayswater Road & been a regular at the Sunday Arts & Craft Market in Cambridge. 
              In 2007 I was acknowledged in the Northampton Chronicle & Echo for painting an ex-Celtic & Northampton town football player.

              I love to paint rock, metal, prog rock , indie, blues, jazz & pop stars  in acrylic or watercolour. My inspiration comes from my love of music. 
              In my youth I was able to see many legendary figures in concert.

              In recent years I have exhibited at festivals where I have met with some of the  performing rock artists. 
              It was great to get photos with Bernie Shaw of Uriah Heep, Mungo Jerry, Leon Hendrix (brother of Jimi Hendrix). 
              I have had paintings signed by David Brock (Hawkwind), Larry Miller, Spike (The Quireboys), Olivia (Mostly Autumn), Ben Poole, Attica Rage, Pat McManus & Bonafide.

              Iâ€™ve taken many photos over the years at festivals and I like to post my photos and paintings regularly on Instagram, 
               Facebook and a selection of my painting can also be seen on <a className="social-handle" href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/MickGoodingCanvasArt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Etsy</a>.
